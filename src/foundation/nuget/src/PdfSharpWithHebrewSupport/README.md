# PdfSharpWithHebrewSupport

PdfSharpWithHebrewSupport is a small, backwards-compatible customization of PDFsharp that adds a simple Hebrew?script (RTL) preprocessing step before text is drawn or measured. It reorders RTL runs for Hebrew-script characters so Hebrew/Yiddish text renders in natural visual order without full shaping engines.
